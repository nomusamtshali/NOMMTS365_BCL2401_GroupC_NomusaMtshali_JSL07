# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

# Project Overview

- I was given a task to create a personalized certificate achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator". This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal.

# Elements Included 

- Input Fields: For user's name, personalized message, and course name.
- Generate Certificate: A button that when clicked, creates the certificate.
- Modal Display: The certificate is shown in a modal window.
- Close Button: For closing the modal.
- Validation: Checks that all fields are completed before certificate generation.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- Understanding and using JavaScript concepts such as variables, events, and DOM manipulation.

## Challenges Faced

- One of the challenges I faced was generating the certificate content dynamically. I had to ensure that it looked good and was generated according to the provided solution (JSL07 Solution.gif).

## Areas of Improvement

- Template literals: I found that learning about modals and how to manipulate them showed me that I need to improve my knowledge on template literals, how they function and the syntax they require.

# Overall Learning Experience

- I really liked the creativity of this project, and the challenge of generating certificate content dynamically. It was a fun and engaging exercise/project. The project really tested my knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM, and I learned how to manipulate elements and content dynamically. It was also a good opportunity to practice event listeners to make the app interactive/close the modal. I think the final output looks great and is very functional! I'm proud of what I've created together.
